## Code standards

Before checking the code standards, please, install the dependencies using:
```
composer install
```

To check the code standards, use:
```

```

To automatically try to resolve the code standards errors, use:
```
composer format
```

If you want to see all the errors and warnings, use:
```

```

To see only the errors and not the warnings, use:
```
php -n ./vendor/bin/phpcs
```
